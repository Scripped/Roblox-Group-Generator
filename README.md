# Roblox-Group-Generator
Generates a random ROBLOX group. Built by a beginner trying to learn javascript.

# Downloading

For some reason, GitHub doesn't allow large files, so, you have to use an extractor (idk what it's called, anything that can extract the files).

So, these are the steps to downloading the generator.

1. Download all of the files -- there should be 3 of them.
2. Put them in a folder.
3. Extract them using an application like 7-zip, or anything similar.
4. There should be an application called Roblox-Group-Generator
5. Open it.

# Tutorial

Once you've opened the application (the one with the electron logo), a purple screen should pop up.
Click generate and everything should work.

# Notes

This will open in your default browser.
Also, I'm a beginner so:
  I don't use the right terminology.
  My code isn't the best.
  
Enjoy.
